  <h2>Research Activity</h2>

  <h3 class="research_accent">Signal Processing and Machine learning</h3>
    <p>In this work, we worked on classification of Media Files based on their location of recording, using Supervised Machine Learning algorithm (support vector machine). We employed a signal extraction algorithm, Fourier Analysis, feature extraction and SVM to classify the origin of recording of audio files, exploiting power signatures embedded in them from the location of recording. Moreover, we managed to introduce a novel feature that increased the classification accuracy by a significant margin. </p>
    <p>Designed a designated device for capturing sample audio data file for ENF at our locality.</p>
    <p>We ranked 11th among 52 teams from 23 countries. The details of the competition are delineated in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tanzilbinhassan/ieee-sp-cup-2016">IEEE SP Cup 2016</a>section of this website.</p>

  <h3 class="research_accent">Undergrad Thesis</h3>
    <h4>"Forward Handover in LTE HetNet"</h4>
    <p>Implemented a novel forward handover scheme for LTE heterogeneous network, which allows Pico to Macrocell handover process to be comparatively faster. As a result, it improves respective user devices to achieve higher minimum received power at the cell edge.</p>
